# Flea FPGA Ohm now supported by ujprog
Forked the project to prepare a port of __ujprog__ for the Flea FPGA Ohm.

2019-11-16 ujprog now finally works with FleaFPGA Ohm. There are some code changes only in the ujprog.c module. Tested (but not much) with Linux and mac OS. I don't have any other boards with the ECP5, so don't know if this version still works with the ULX3S boards for instance.

## tools
ULX2S / ULX3S FPGA JTAG programmer &amp; tools (Lattice XP2 / ECP5)
